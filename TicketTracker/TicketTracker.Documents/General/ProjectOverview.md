# Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a simple ticket tracking system. It is going to be similar to Jira or ZenDesk. We're doing this project as a way to keep our skills sharp and also use some technology we've never used before. For example the hopeful use of Blazor as the front end UI builder and AWS for hosting. We are also going to use this as a chance to address some of the gripes we have with things like Jira and ZenDesk.

This document aims to set out the project goals and technology used. We will also be producing as much documentation as we can in support of the project goals. Each sprint will have a description attached and any supporting documents as well.
