# Introduction

## *Purpose of Document*

This is a Requirements Specification document for a new Ticket Trakcing system meant as a home project. Ticket Tracking systems are widely used in a number of industries to help track issues or problems within a company. This document will describe the scope, objectives and goal of the new system. In addition to describing non-functional requirements, this document models functional ones with some Use Case examples, diagrams and class models. Some of these will be referenced as another file as well. This document is intended to direct the design and implementation of the target system in an object orientated language. (C#).

## *Background*

Ticket Tracking software is used the world over to help co ordinate everything from IT Support issues, Bug tracking in software and also project management. Ticket Trackers such as Jira, Asana and ZenDesk are some examples. This project hopes to emulate it and make our own custom solution. 

Currently there are several ticket tracking systems on the market that have similar capabilities, most of them also have extensive teams and other options available as a whole suite of tools for project management. 

This project aims to create a standalone Ticket Tracking system that does not require the user to have intimate knowledge of project management or agile practices. It will also not require the user to be part of a massive suite of projects and will allow the user complete control of their own tickets and data stored within.

## *Project Scope*

The scope of the project will be a web based cloud backed ticket tracker that supports users for a multitude of reasons. Ticket Tracking, User Access Control and Data Management will be at the heart of the project.

## *System Purpose*

### *Users*

Thos who will primarily benefit from the new system and thos who will be affected by it:

- Project Managers
  - Upon entring a ticket into a system, PMs should find tracking or creating a ticket easy as possible.
- Administrators
  - Administrators should be able to deal with User Management in the simplest way to them. Be that on boarding new people to the board or removing ones.
- Technicians
  - Technicians should be able to see the tickets they have assigned and also enter any and all information on to them that makes things as easy as possible for working through them.
